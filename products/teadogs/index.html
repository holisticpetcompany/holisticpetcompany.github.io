    <p>All our infusions are intended to be used by adding them to your dog's food (this works especially well on dry food), although some dogs will also drink them on their own, like tea.</p>
    <p>To make a cuppa for your dog follow these easy steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add half a teaspoon of your chosen Teadog's blend to half a cup of hot water.</li>
      <li>Allow it to steep for five minutes.</li>
      <li>Top up with cold water and serve with your dog's food twice daily, or offer as a drink.</p>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>It's as simple as that!</strong></p>
    <p>Each tin of Teadogs contains enough herbs for 30 days usage.</p>
    <p>Refills are available.</p>

    <p><strong>Zen dog</strong> is a herbal infusion especially formulated to promote calmness and to relieve anxiety. It can be used for situations that some dogs find stressful such as thunderstorms, fireworks night, trips to the vet or as an aid in separation anxiety. It can also help to promote a restful night's sleep and can help dogs to settle in a new home or when away in kennels.</p>
    <p>Zen dog contains a blend of traditional nervine, or calming herbs, that have been used for centuries to relieve anxiety and settle the mind. Our vet Holly has chosen a blend that includes Chamomile and Passionflower.</p>

    <p><strong>Old dog</strong> is a herbal infusion especially formulated to help relieve the effects of old age and to help support your dog through their senior years.</p>
    <p>It can be especially helpful for dogs that suffer from anxiety and confusion as they grow older, when deafness and poor eyesight can make them feel more vulnerable. It's also aimed at supporting dogs that are suffering from age-related forgetfulness and confusion (a bit like doggie dementia!).</p>
    <p>Old dog contains a blend of herbs that have been used for centuries to relieve the most common effects of ageing and to help maintain a healthy immune system. The herbs are especially selected by our vet Holly to support the heart and circulatory system and because they are a rich source of antioxidants. Old dog contains a blend of herbs including Hawthorn.</p>
