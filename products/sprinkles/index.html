    <p>Our range of effective and 100% organic herbal Sprinkles has been formulated and produced in small batches by our vet Holly Mash. She has developed each one to meet the needs of her patients and we think that they'll help your dog too.</p>
    <p>Each Sprinkle comes in a self-seal pouch, to keep the herbs fresh. Just add a 'Sprinkle', or half a teaspoonful, to your dog's food every day (or as needed) to support their health easily and effectively. It's as simple as that!</p>
    <p>Each pouch of Sprinkles contains enough herbs for 30 days usage.</p>
