    <p>We are a small company based in Bristol making beautifully packaged, natural pet health products such as herbal infusions, creams and salves. We aim to offer natural solutions for the most common ailments affecting pets, using traditional knowledge alongside modern science. Our product range is designed to support and balance a pet's health gently and effectively, using the healing power of nature.</p>
    <p>Every product has been especially formulated by our in house vet Holly Mash who has specialised in complementary medicine and herbalism over the past ten years.  All our products are manufactured by hand in very small batches at our base in Bristol and the majority of the herbs we use are native to the British countryside.</p>
