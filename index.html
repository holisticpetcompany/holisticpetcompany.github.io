    <p>We are a small company based in Bristol making beautifully packaged, natural pet health products. With our range of herbal Sprinkles and teas we offer natural solutions for the most common ailments affecting pets, using traditional knowledge alongside modern science. Our product range is designed to support and balance a pet's health gently and effectively, using the healing power of nature.</p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Every product has been especially formulated by our in house vet Holly Mash, who has a post graduate diploma in Veterinary Western Herbal Medicine and has practised complementary veterinary medicine for over ten years. All our products are manufactured by hand in very small batches at our base in Bristol and the majority of the herbs we use are native to the British countryside.</p>
