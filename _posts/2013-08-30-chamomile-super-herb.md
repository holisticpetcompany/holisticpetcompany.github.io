Chamomile deserves a special mention as it is has so many incredible properties. We use it in both our Zen dog as well as our Smelly dog tea, for it's soothing, calming and anti-spasmodic effects that can help to ease digestive complaints.

Chamomile is native to the whole of the British isles but is much more commonly found in the south, on short grassland and sandy soil. This native type is Roman Chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile), a creeping perennial. However, it is a related species, German chamomile, (Matricaria recutita), a taller annual, which is more commonly used in herbal medicine and is the type we use in our teas.

Medicinally, Chamomile has been valued at least since the time of the ancient Egyptians and in medieval times it was known as one of the nine most sacred herbs. It was used as a strewing herb as when crushed underfoot it gives off a nice aroma, (some say like apples), and so made medieval homes smell better! We now know that Chamomile has active properties that allow it to work as a mild sedative, as a reliever of spasm in the intestinal tract, as a digestive tonic and that it can be effective in a range of situations. Modern day herbalists use it for treating headaches, indigestion and topically for skin complaints. In veterinary medicine it is used for impaired digestion, bloating, flatulence and it is also of course a well known calming and anti-anxiety remedy.

The renowned animal herbalist Juliette de Bairacli Levy recommended the use of chamomile tea as a treatment for patients with diarrhoea and gastroenteritis as well as being good for inflamed gums.

Make your dog a bedtime cuppa for a peaceful night's sleep.
