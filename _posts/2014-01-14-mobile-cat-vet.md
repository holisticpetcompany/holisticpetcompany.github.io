Ever heard of a mobile cat vet? Neither had I. But seven years in general small animal practice taught me that it was something that the feline population might appreciate!

Being dragged away from their warm bed, shoved into a basket, driven in a car and placed in a room full of barking dogs is not exactly their idea of a good time. I've always loved cats, and the more I learned about them the more I grew to respect their particular needs, both physically and mentally. So, when I finally got the opportunity to start a practice of my own, I knew it had to be a home visiting service just for cats.

The response of both my patients and their owners has been incredibly positive. A few small changes such as a feline-friendly staff, medications and handling techniques all go a long way toward putting cats at ease. Avoiding the stressful car journey makes for a much friendlier patient, along with an owner who can concentrate on providing a good medical history and learning how to give any necessary treatments. 

Home visits also tend to be more thorough, and although we do have access to clinic facilities when necessary, we have found that the vast majority of concerns can be dealt with quickly, safely and stress-free in the cat's own home.

Now that I've seen how relaxed a vet visit can be, I could never go back to clinic work. At the end of the day, my feline patients are happy and that's what it's all about.
