Keeping your dogs paw pads well nourished is a bit like us using hand cream. Being on the ground all day, their pads will see a lot of wear and tear! And just like our hands, your dog's feet can be affected by the extremes of weather - hot pavements or icy ground can be equally responsible for causing pads to crack and split. Ouch!

This unique blend of oils is geared towards healing and protecting your dog's paws. Shea butter is well known for its superb moisturizing properties and for its healing action on the skin. The coconut and almond oils add to this balm's exceptional nourishing effect, helping to lock in moisture and prevent damage.

Essential oil of orange gives the balm a beautiful, uplifting scent - some owners have been known to get their own tin to use as a wonderful lip balm!

~~Paw Balm will be available to buy on our website soon, in the meantime please feel free to [contact us](/contact/) for more information.~~ **Edit: Paw Balm is [now available](/products/balms/) online.**
