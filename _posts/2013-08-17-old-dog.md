Our Old dog is a herbal infusion especially formulated to relieve the effects of old age and to support your dog through their senior years.

As the body slows down and the mind becomes a bit cloudy and confused, you can use Old dog tea to help your companion to cope with the ageing process as it affects them both physically and mentally.

It can be especially helpful for dogs that suffer anxiety and confusion as they grow older, when deafness and poor eyesight can make them feel more vulnerable.  It's also aimed at supporting dogs that are suffering with age related forgetfulness and confusion (a bit like doggie dementia!)

All our teas are intended to be used by adding them to your dog's food, (this works especially well on dry food),  although some dogs do drink them neat, like tea!

Old dog contains a blend of herbs that have been used for centuries to relieve the most common effects of ageing and to help maintain a healthy immune system. These herbs particularly support the heart and circulatory system and are a rich source of antioxidants. Our vet Holly has chosen a blend that includes Hawthorn, Lemon Balm and Bilberry.

Supporting your dog in old age is as easy as making a cuppa!
