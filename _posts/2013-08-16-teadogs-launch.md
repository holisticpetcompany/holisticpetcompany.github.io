The very first batch of our herbal tea for dogs has been dispatched to Stripy Dog, a lovely family run pet shop in Westbury on Trym, Bristol.

This herbal tea range has been a long time project for Holistic Pet Company founder Holly Mash, she's been mulling over the best combination of herbs for each blend for over a year. So, to see the tins full of amazing smelling herbs all packaged up and ready to go was a great moment!

As a vet and also a herbalist Holly has chosen a special combination of herbs for each of her blend of teas so that they are gentle, safe and most importantly effective. Her patients as well as her family's dog Penny (a very adorable Cocker spaniel) have been the canine tasters and testers and have given these three teas the paws up!
