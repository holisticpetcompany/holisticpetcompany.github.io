Our Smelly dog tea is a herbal infusion especially formulated to promote a healthy digestion and to help with antisocial, (and unhealthy), problems such as bloating and flatulence.

After all, a properly functioning digestive system is the basis of good health. Dogs with loose stools, variable appetite, flatulence or bloating are not getting the most out of the nutrients in their diet and this will have knock on effects on their overall health. (And no one wants to share the sofa with a stinker!)

All our teas are intended to be used by adding them to your dog's food, (this works especially well on dry food), Â although some dogs do drink them neat, like tea!

Smelly dog contains a blend of herbs that have traditionally been used to support and maintain a healthy and efficient digestive system. These herbs also have nutritive qualities and are a source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Our vet Holly has chosen a blend that includes Fennel, Chamomile, Aniseed and Alfalfa.

Improving your dog's digestion is as easy as making a cuppa!
