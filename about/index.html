    <h2>About The Holistic Pet Company</h2>
    <p class="lead">We specialise in formulating and producing natural pet health products such as herbal infusions, creams and salves. We have holistic health at the heart of what we do and aim to restore balance to a pet's mind as well as their body with all our products.</p>
    <p>At the Holistic Pet Company we only use 100% natural ingredients, ethically sourced and organic where possible. The majority of the herbs that we use are traditional European wild flowers and plants that have been valued for centuries for their healing properties. Holly Mash, a qualified vet, animal herbalist and nutritionist developed every product to meet the needs of the patients that she treats every day. Each product has a special story behind it, whether it was the creaky old spaniel who inspired the mobility formula or the itchy pug who was the first beneficiary of our soothing skin cream.</p>
    <p>We aim to offer natural solutions for the most common ailments affecting pets, using traditional knowledge alongside modern science. Our product range is designed to support and balance a pet's health gently and effectively, using the healing power of nature.</p>
    <p>Every product is made in small-batches and quality control checks are carried out at every step to ensure safety.</p>
