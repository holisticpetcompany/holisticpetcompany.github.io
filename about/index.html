    <h2>About The Holistic Pet Company</h2>
    <p class="lead">We specialise in formulating and producing Sprinkles and teas &ndash; a unique range of organic herbal supplements for pets. We have natural health at the heart of what we do and aim to restore balance to a pet's mind as well as their body with all our products.</p>
    <p>At the Holistic Pet Company we only use 100% ethically sourced, fairly traded, organic herbs &ndash; and nothing else. The majority of the herbs that we use are traditional European wild flowers and plants that have been valued for centuries for their healing properties. Holly Mash, a qualified vet, animal herbalist and nutritionist developed every product to meet the needs of the patients that she treats every day. Each product has a special story behind it, whether it was the creaky old spaniel who inspired the mobility formula or the itchy pug who was the first beneficiary of our Itchy Dog Sprinkle.</p>
    <p>The range of herbal Sprinkles and teas offers a natural solution for the most common ailments affecting pets, using traditional knowledge alongside modern science. Our product range is designed to support and balance a pet's health gently and effectively, using the healing power of nature.</p>
